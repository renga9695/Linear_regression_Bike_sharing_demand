# Linear Regression Model
> A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

## General Information
- Analysing the Demand of the Bike sharing system using the given dataset
- The dataset is provided the information about the bike share by a US based company for 2 years
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->




## Technologies Used
- pandas
- python
- Jupyter Lab
- sklearn 
- stats_model

<!-- As the libraries versions keep on changing, it is recommended to mention the version of library used in this project -->

## Conclusions
- The R2 Score of Train dataset is 0.79
- The Adjusted r2_score of the Train Dataset is 0.74
- The R2 Score of Test dataset is 0.75
- The Adjusted r2_score of the Test Dataset is 0.73

The Features temp,workingday,windspeed,yr,sun,winter,jan,aug,mar,feb,holiday,light_snow are playing makor role in the creating the demand of the shared bikes
